### Intro
It's really easy to get overwhelmed when you start your CPAP journey. There is a deluge of new information and an almost infinite number of rabitholes to go down. This will hopefully give you the essential, TLDR; for starting CPAP therapy (the right way).

### Data
The first thing you should when you get your new CPAP machine is load in a fresh new SD card. CPAP machines typically don't come with them (I bought a ResMed Airsense 11 from Lofta and then a ResMed Aircurve 10 VAuto BiPAP from secondwindcpap and neither came with an SD card).

Modern CPAP machines can take up to a 32 GB SD Card, which should run you about $12. And that will provision capacity for more than a decade of CPAP data.

Installing one of these in your machine will allow you to collect extremely detailed data from your nightly CPAP sessions, which will become invaluable as you optimize your therapy over time. It's not critical that you have it the first night, but the sooner you get it, the better.

### Comfort
First and foremost, you should focus on making your therapy comfortable. If it's not comfortable, you won't stick with it. The tricky part is that comfort is a very subjective. I can't tell you exactly what will be comfortable for you, but I can give you a list of things to check out / try that may make your therapy more comfortable.

#### Mask Type
Finding the right mask for you is one of the first big hurdles you will encounter on your CPAP journey. The mask plays such a big role in determining the success of one's therapy. 

If you go to a DME they should let you try out a couple of masks. However, it is really hard to tell in that moment if a mask is going to be right for you. You will need to try it out over the course of a couple of nights to have an idea if it is going to work for you.

Most doctors / DMEs prefer to start people on the nasal mask, which is probably the easiest type of mask to onboard with. It offers decent comfort while being relatively easy to get a good seal with. The only reason why you should not start with this mask is if you know you are a mouthbreather (or at least breath through your mouth when sleeping). One of the surest signs of mouthbreathing is if you frequently wake up with dry mouth in the mornings. 

If you are a mouthbreather, you will want to start with a hybrid or full face mask option. I would recommend starting with the full face mask, but I am biased. I found the hybrid masks to be kind of a mixed bag. Using a full face mask as a mouthbreather will allow you to internalize your therapy and not have it all escape out of your open mouth! Take it from a mouthbreather that resisted the full face mask for far too long: you will be far happier and have far better therapy with a full face mask.

#### Pressure
Depending on your situation, you may or may not receive a machine that is tailored for your therapy by a medical professional using the data gathered from your sleep study. If you DO receive a machine that has been configured for you, stick with those settings. If you DO NOT receive one that has been set up for you, it's probably worth adjusting the default pressure settings. If you are unsure, you can compare the pressure settings on your machine to the factory defaults (you will probably have to look up what the defaults are online). For the ResMed Airsense 11 the default therapy settings are APAP (auto) mode with a minimum pressure of 4 and maximum pressure of 20. 

This represents the entire range of pressure values the machine can offer and will likely not be comfortable for you. The minimum pressure is too low for the average adult and the maximum pressure is too high for the vast majority of CPAP users. 

When therapy "too low" it means that a CPAP user might struggle to breathe at those levels. For example, in my own therapy, I feel starved for air below a minimum pressure of 9.0. A higher minimum will ensure that you feel that you are getting enough air on each breath.

When I say "too high" I mean that therapy at the level is going to be uncomfortable without providing any additional therapeutic benefit to the user. There's no harm at receiving therapy at that level, but there's no real value either. 

**NOTE: This is a generalization. There are plenty of cases where patients with severe sleep apnea will need very high levels of pressure to benefit from therapy.**

Theoretically, the machine should adjust itself throughout the night and only provide the pressure it thinks you need. But why start at a pressure that is likely to be insufficient and extend to a pressure that you are unlikely to ever get therapeutic benefits from? 

You can safely increase your minimum pressure between 7-9 and decrease your max pressure to 12-15. You will probably need to continue finetuning your pressure range over time, but that should give you a better chance of being being comfortable as you acclimate to CPAP therapy.

**ANOTHER NOTE: You will need to activate clinical mode on your machine to adjust some of these settings. Depending on the doctor, they might not appreciate you adjusting your machine on your own. But it is YOUR THERAPY and YOUR HEALTH, never forget that.**

#### EPR / Pressure Support
In ResMed CPAP machines, "EPR" aka "Expiratory Pressure Relief" is a comfort setting that the machine's pressure delivery during your exhale, making it easier for you to exhale. There's more to be said about this setting in a longer, dedicated article, but for now know that it is a great tool to make your therapy more comfortable. EPR is disabled by default, but can be set from 0 to 3. Setting EPR to 3 made my own therapy substantially more tolerable and I found that I needed it even after I acclimated to my CPAP. Try it out and see which level feels the best for you.

#### ClimateLine
If your CPAP machine has a ClimateLine tube option, get the ClimateLine. Using that in combination with your water-filled reservoir will make for a much more comfortable experience. You may need to tweak the humidity settings over time if you experience rainout (condensation in your mask). 

It is worth mentioning that the ClimateLine is marginally more expensive than the base tube offering.

### Leaks
After getting comfortable with your therapy, it's now time to tackle any mask leaks that may be getting in between you and a good night's sleep. 

Your machine typically has a summary page somewhere on it that will tell you how much your mask leaked in a given night. These summary pages can vary from decent to downright useless. For example the ResMed Aircurve 10 uses a smiley face system, which is worthless, but the ResMed Airsense 11 provides an average leak number.

You may never get to 0.0 leak average (and that's okay), but you should strive to at least eliminate large leaks and optimize to your best ability from there. Large leaks will typically wake you up or greatly disturb your therapy.

The primary cause of mask leaks are:
* Poor mask fit
* Mask type incompatibility

For the mask fit issues, again YMMV, but I have found that I really need to pull my straps tight on my ResMed AirFit F20 full face mask or I leak all night. It just takes some trial and error to figure out how you can get a good seal using the mask of your choice.

However, you may find that no matter what you do, you can't get your leaks under control. This suggests that your choice of mask is either incompatible with your breathing (mouthbreathing most likely) or the mask is not compatible with your sleep habits. 

As an active sleeper and a mask breather I really had a tough time getting my leaks under control. The AirFit P10 nasal pillows were so comfortable and I wanted them to work for me so badly. But, no matter what I did, I couldn't keep my mouth closed while using it (even when using a chinstrap!). I eventually had to throw in the towel. I switched to the full face mask and never looked back. And honestly, once I got used to it, it's a pretty great mask. I just wish it wasn't such a pain to scratch my nose in the middle of the night. 

### Position
You might hate to hear this, but while using a CPAP machine, you really should try to sleep on your side. 

I fought this simple truth for a long time, much to my own detriment. I did not think I was capable of sleeping on my side due to shoulder pain. But, with perserverance and enough pillows I have managed to make it work. And what a world of difference it has made. It took my average AHI (number of apnea events per hour) of somewhere between 1.0 and 2.5 reliably below 1.0 on most nights. That might not seem substantial, but it was instrumental in reducing the number of disturbances I had in a given night.

This might not be something you want or need to do on Day 1, but keep it in the back of your mind as you continue throughout your own therapy journey.

### Optimize
Remember that SD card I mentioned earlier? Now it's time to let your data do the talkin'.

Pop out your SD card and upload it to your computer. Many modern laptops and computers do not have SD card readers anymore, so you will probably need an external SD card reader or some type of adapter that will allow you to connect it to your computer. I bought one on Amazon for $10 that allows me to upload it to my laptop.

Now you have a couple of options with regards to software you can use to visualize your CPAP data, but the most popular is OSCAR, which is an open source solution developed by the CPAP community. 

Once you have downloaded the software for your operating system, you will need to create a local account. After you have created an account, select your account to use it, at which point you will be prompted to upload your CPAP data. The software is smart enough where it should be able to self-discover the location your CPAP data on your adapter or SD card reader. 


### Legal

Please do your own due diligence and only follow the advice you feel comfortable with. I am NOT a doctor. I'm just a guy on the Internet. But if you are reading this, I have been in your shoes. I became so disgusted with the way the medical community treats sleep disorders, I took charge of my own therapy. And I am healthier and happier for having done so.

I don't recommend anything in this article that A) haven't tried or B) wouldn't do myself.
