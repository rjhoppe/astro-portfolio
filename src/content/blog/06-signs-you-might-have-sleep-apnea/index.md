The information provided in this article has been gathered through extensive research along with trial and error. Please do your own due diligence and only follow the advice you feel comfortable with. I am NOT a doctor. I'm just a guy on the Internet. But if you are reading this, I have been in your shoes. I became so disgusted with the way the medical community treats sleep disorders, I took charge of my own therapy. And I am healthier and happier for having done so.

I don't recommend anything in this article that A) haven't tried or B) wouldn't do myself.
