â€œAll nature is but art, unknown to thee; <br>
All chance, direction, which thou canst not see; <br>
All discord, harmony not understood; <br>
All partial evil, universal good. <br>
And, spite of pride, in erring reason's spite, <br>
One truth is clear, 'Whatever is, is right.'" <br>

Alexander Pope, An Essay on Man
