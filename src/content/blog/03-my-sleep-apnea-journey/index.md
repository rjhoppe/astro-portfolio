### Preface

This is going to be a long article. 

I am going to attempt to meticulously outline my journey and recovery in *GREAT DETAIL* with the hopes that this might help others that find themselves in a similar position.

**TLDR;** <br>
Sleep apnea is a *__LIFE THREATENING__* condition. Effectively treating sleep apnea can __save your life__, __dramatically increase your quality of life__, and __substantially improve your overall satisfaction of life.__ If you suspect you may have sleep apnea, please continue reading for what I hope will be helpful guidance.

### Intro

The stereotypical sleep apnea patient is described as a man that is  overweight, over the age of 40, that engages in regular smoking and/or drinking and snores while sleeping.

Like most overgeneralizations, this is not particularly helpful for those who fall outside of this very narrow description. However, it is not entirely without it it's merits, as this stereotype accurately described everyone in my sleep study besides myself. 

*Accedotal?*  Undoubtedly.

### A Non-Stereotypical Case

Enter me, stage right. 

- 6'3 (6'4 if you ask me)
- 192 lbs 
- 29 years old (at the time when I first began suffering from sleep apnea) 
- Go to the gym four days a week
- Drink alcohol socially on the weekends 
- Mindful of my diet, but allow myself to cheat every so often. 
- On weekdays, I go to bed between 10:30 PM - 12:00 AM
- On weekends, I go to bed between 12:00 AM - 2:00 AM (I go a little nuts)
- Take one 3mg dose of Melatonin at night before bed to help fall asleep

This profile doesn't entirely match with the preconceived notion of a sleep apnea patient. Which made it difficult to arrive at the proper sleep apnea diagnosis from a medical professional and also made it harder for me to accept that sleep apnea was the root cause of my sleep troubles. In fact, the most common reaction to me telling friends, family, etc. that I have sleep apnea is surprise and disbelief. 

Trust me, I was surprised too.

### Sleep Apnea Is A Condition Hard to Quantify
>A recent study by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) revealed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) could be a hidden health crisis costing America billions. The study showed there are approximately 30 million Americans suffering from obstructive sleep apnea; yet only 6 million people are officially diagnosed. This means that 80 percent of people with OSA are undiagnosed. Additionally, the AASM revealed that due to workplace accidents, automobile accidents, comorbid diseases and loss in productivity, the United States is losing a combined $149.6 billion because of OSA.

### Sleep Apnea in Professional Athletics
- Shaquille O'Neal
- Ryan Jensen
- Reggie White
- Roy Green
- Warren Sapp
- Percy Harvin
- Josh James

Some of these athletes claim that getting their sleep apnea condition diagnosed and treated saved their careers. In addition, former athletes like Warren Sapp and Roy Green are now focusing on promoting awareness of sleep apnea.

The [source](https://www.cpap.com/blogs/sleep-apnea/athletes-with-sleep-apnea?srsltid=AfmBOorrosoiB1fB8LAjPbr05C-PZtnSfKyJT3HignKgZPYW2Ya9wg7e) article is a great read. 

### Initial Symptoms
I first experienced symptoms for sleep apnea in October 2022, roughly a year and a half before I was officially diagnosed. 

I began waking up in the middle of the night with heart palpitations. This was something I had never experienced before. Up until this point, I had mostly slept fine. If I went to bed early enough (i.e. gave myself enough time to get a good night's sleep), I would get my 7.5 - 9 hours of sleep I needed to function optimally the next day. 

This was new and it was odd. 

However, once my heartrate calmed back down, I was able to fall back asleep and would not reawaken. So, at least the issue was not recurring multiple times in the same night.

I thought that the issue was due to work related stress. I opted to visit the doctor just to make sure. After asking me questions related to my health and the issue I was experiencing, the doctor opted to have my thyroid checked through some blood tests, as I was concerned this could be the culprit due to some hyperthyroidism in my family.

The blood tests came back and there was nothing to suggest in my bloodwork that my thyroid was at fault. Therefore, the doctor concluded the issue was stress related and sent me home with some reading materials on how to relax effectively before bed.

A couple weeks passed and the middle of the night awakenings abated. I returned to sleeping normally.

### Symptoms Intensify
I began experiencing lasting bouts of insomnia in March 2024. I would sometimes go 2-3 nights without good rest and then finally fall into the kind of deep sleep only someone starved of sleep could experience. However, the insomnia would start right back up again.

After a couple of weeks of this, I scheduled a virtual doctor's appointment. I explained this issues I was having to the doctor and she prescribed me with a prescription grade antihistamine that is used to treat anxiety/sleep disorders in low doses. HOWEVER, it is important to note that telehealth doctor did mention my symptoms did seem like they could be related to sleep apnea (kudos to her). This was a potential outcome that I did not or could believe at the time. I really wanted the root cause of my sleep trials to be ANYTHING, but sleep apnea. I couldn't fathom spending the rest of my life hooked up to a machine while I slept. I was determined to try any and every solution before I a resigned myself to a CPAP fate. 

I probably delayed my recovery by about 2 months with this line of thinking. That being said...

The antihistamine kind of worked, I guess? I think it made a difference for the first two weeks I was on it and then I stopped noticing a difference. The sleep issues returned all the same.

I finally went to see the doctor in person, with the three-fold mission of getting my bloodwork done, my vitamin levels checked, and securing an SSRI prescription. A family friend claimed that an SSRI helped fix their sleep issues. My bloodwork came back okay and there was nothing that stood out in my vitamin levels (although it was recommended that I start taking a Vitamin D and Vitamin B supplement). But, most importantly, I got my SSRI prescription (trazodone).

I really thought trazodone was going to solve all my problems...

### Road to Therapy
After a couple weeks of mixed (mostly negligible) success, I began to rethink my current approach. Perhaps medication was not the answer. And then I had my first recognizeable apnea event. I woke up in the middle of the night gasping and with heart palpitations. Up until that point I had woken up in the middle of night, but never had experienced the combintation of heart palpitations AND gasping. Even heart palpitations were fairly rare up until that point.

After looking up my symptoms and remembering the words of my telehealth doctor, I began to suspect sleep apnea as the root cause of my sleep troubles.

And then an apnea event happened again. And again. At this point I was convinced. Time to seek out treatment.

### At Home Sleep Study
I did some research and eventually landed on Lofta's Home Sleep Test. It's important to note why you might consider doing an at home sleep study vs one at a sleep lab:
* Cheap (~$190 vs >$1,000 overnight sleep study in a lab)
* Accessible (i.e. no need to wait for an appointment)
* Accurate enough for a binary sleep apnea verdict
* If done through Lofta, they can immediately grant you a CPAP prescription if test positive for sleep apnea

**NOTE: It is worth mentioning that I am NOT sponsored by Lofta**

An at home sleep study will, in most cases, be REMARKABLY cheaper than an overnight in-lab sleep study. Health insurance coverage for sleep apnea related treatment is typically awful. I have been on two separate providers and have largely paid all costs out of pocket. Even if you are lucky to have insurance that will foot the bill of your treatment, it is important to be aware of the "gotchas" associated with sleep apnea coverage.

#### Scheduling
You *likely* will need to schedule your in-lab sleep study, months in advance. Many of these labs can only host a handful of patients on any given night. For example, my in-lab sleep study group was 6 people and I do not believe they had a new batch of sleep study patients come in every night. YMMV, but I have to wait 3 months for my in-lab sleep study appointment, but I heard people waiting 6-8 months for an appointment.

And at the end of the day, a sleep study is the STARTING POINT for sleep apnea treatment. Meaning, you have to wait around for several months to get to the starting line for treatment, meanwhile potentially suffering a serious condition. This may not be an acceptable tradeoff. 

#### Compliance
Before letting you keep your machine, many insurance companies will make you rent out a CPAP machine for a trial period. This is so they do not have to give away CPAP machines to people that they do not believe will commit to CPAP therapy. During the trial period, they will charge you a flat rental fee and observe your nightly usage. If you fall below the compliance threshold they will not let you keep the CPAP machine. This can be stressful to someone who is having trouble adjusting to see CPAP therapy. It can take several weeks or months for a new user to feel comfortable wearing their mask for an entire night. 

#### DMEs
A DME (Durable Medical Equipment) is the organization that your insurance will send you too for all your CPAP equipment. Masks, tubes, reservoirs, CPAP machines, etc. all come from this medical equipment provider. And they are truly criminals. They exploit the insurance system in the US to charge OUTRAGEOUS prices for the equipment they provide you. Much of the cost should be absorbed by your insurance company, but not all of it. When Ben Kenobi told Luke he would "never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy" he was looking directly at the Mos Eisley DME.

A "good" DME might properly fit you for a mask (one of the only advantages to going to one of these in person is that you will have the opportunity to briefly try on many different styles of masks), but again YMMV. You are much more likely to feel nickel and dime'd at one of these then be provided a valuable service. 

It is also worth mentioning that the timelines your DME and CPAP suppliers will suggest for your replacing your equipment are also ridiculous. You do not need to replace your equipment as often as they suggest. They exist FOR PROFIT and it behooves them that you replace your equipment often.

### At-Home Sleep Study Results
Back to my story. The at home sleep study took 3 days to arrive from Lofta and I followed their instructions for conducting an at-home test. It was pretty straight forward. The results came in within 48 hours.

I tested positive for mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea based on pAHI=5.0, pRDI=18.6 and O2 nadir of 90%.

AHI is an important metric for evaluating the severity of sleep apnea. It stands for Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) is used to represent the number of apneic events per hour where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. That means in this particular sleep study I averaged a whooping 5 apneic events per hour! No wonder I wasn't sleeping well. The crazy thing is 5 AHI is relatively tame when it comes to range of sleep apnea severity experiences. There are poor souls that exceed 100 events per hour!

Another number from that study worth mentioning is the O2 nadir of 90%. Your O2 level should ideally be between 95-100% while sleeping. Sustained periods below 95% are very bad for your long term health (particularly your heart health).
