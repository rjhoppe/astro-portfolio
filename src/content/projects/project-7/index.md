I love the PreMarket prep YouTube [show](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBv33AsU80MB87Whtnx_9Fw), but rarely have time to watch the whole show in the mornings. I wrote this app to generate a one-pager from the show's transcript (using Mistral) and send it to my locally hosted wastebin instance, as well as to one of my Discord channels
