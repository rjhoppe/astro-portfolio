Initially written in Java [link](https://github.com/rjhoppe/aoe2-randomizer) to get some more practice with the language and then migrated over to Go. I routinely play Age of Empires with my family and this bot helps to set up games by randomly generating game settings and civlizations. Also includes various helper functions that provide info on the various civilizations you can play as.
