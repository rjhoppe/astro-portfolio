Truly the dumbest and most fun thing I have ever created. This bot runs on a cron schedule to generate a fake name, fake email, and fake customer question to submit to a Shopify chatbot. This particular Shopify chatbot plugin does not validate ANY customer information and when a customer question is submitted it goes right to the email or text inbox of a store.
